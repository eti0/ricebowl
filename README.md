Something really autistic about ricing in a given time limit.

## So what is this about ?
A competition similar to a game jam.  
Participants must [rice](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/GNU/Linux_ricing) their desktop in a certain time limit.  
When the timer starts the theme of the ricebowl run will be announced. Participants will then have to make their rice related to the announced theme.
After reaching the time limit, a link to a screenshot (or multiple screenshots) must be submitted to the [ricebowl gallery](https://rice.church/) where anyone (anyone really) can vote for their favorite rice.
